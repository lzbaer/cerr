#Computational Environment for Radiotherapy Research.

# Introduction #

CERR (pronounced 'sir') is a software platform for developing and sharing research results in radiation therapy treatment planning. CERR is written in the widely-used Matlab language allowing for low-cost development of visualization and analysis tools. CERR will import and display treatment plans from a wide variety of commercial or academic treatment planning systems including both the RTOG and the DICOM-RT formats. CERR provides a common filetype for the creation of multi-institutional treatment plan databases for various types of research studies, including dose-volume-outcomes analyses and IMRT treatment planning comparisons.
