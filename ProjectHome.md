CERR (pronounced 'sir') is a software platform for developing and sharing research results in radiation therapy treatment planning.

CERR is written in the widely-used Matlab language (version 7.0 or later), allowing for low-cost development of visualization and analysis tools.

CERR will import and display treatment plans from a wide variety of commercial or academic treatment planning systems (including both the RTOG format and the DICOM-RT format).

CERR provides a common filetype for the creation of multi-institutional treatment plan databases for various types of research studies, including dose-volume-outcomes analyses and IMRT treatment planning comparisons.
